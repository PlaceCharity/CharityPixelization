# charity-pixelization

a blazingly fast* pixelization library for charity

**writing that made me feel pain*

## build the dang thing

make sure you have [rustup](https://rustup.rs) installed, and that you've added the rust-src component if you're planning on making WASM bundles.

if you want to make a WASM bundle, install wasm-pack and run

```
wasm-pack build --target web --features wasm
```
